//! Application Layer Traits
//!
//! This module defines the core traits used to bridge the Modbus protocol stack with
//! user-defined application logic. It follows a callback-based (observer) pattern
//! where the stack notifies the application of successful responses or failures.
//!
//! Each trait corresponds to a functional group of Modbus services (Coils, Registers, etc.).

    ///     - `unit_id`: if transport is tcp
    ///     - `slave_addr`: if transport is serial
    /// - `data`: Raw identity/status data provided by the manufacturer.
