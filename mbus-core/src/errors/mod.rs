//! Modbus Error Module
//!
//! This module defines the centralized error handling for the Modbus stack.
//! It provides the [`MbusError`] enum, which covers a wide range of error conditions
//! including protocol-specific exceptions, parsing failures, transport-layer issues,
//! and buffer management errors.
//!
//! The error types are designed to be compatible with `no_std` environments while
//! providing descriptive error messages through the `Display` trait implementation.
//!
//! Modbus Specification Reference: V1.1b3, Section 7 (MODBUS Exception Responses).
