# Modbus-rs Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the `modbus-rs` library's architecture, focusing on its core components and their interactions. The library is designed for `no_std` compatibility, offering a robust and flexible Modbus client implementation suitable for embedded systems.

## Core Components

The `modbus-rs` ecosystem is composed of several crates, each with a distinct responsibility:

-   **`mbus-core`**: Provides fundamental Modbus data structures, error types, and the `Transport` trait for abstracting communication layers.
-   **`mbus-client`**: Implements the Modbus client state machine and services for handling various Modbus function codes.
-   **`mbus-async`**: Provides an async facade (`AsyncTcpClient`, `AsyncSerialClient`) over the poll-driven client core.
-   **`mbus-network`**: Provides the standard TCP transport implementation (`StdTcpTransport`).
-   **`mbus-serial`**: Provides standard Serial transport implementations (`StdSerialTransport`) for RTU/ASCII modes.
-   **`mbus-ffi`**: Provides native C bindings and WASM/browser bindings.
-   **`modbus-rs`**: Top-level convenience crate that re-exports workspace APIs behind feature flags.
-   **`integration_tests`**: End-to-end validation across TCP, serial, and async flows.
-   **`xtask`**: Workspace automation commands (header generation/checks and C smoke build/test).

At the top-level `modbus-rs` crate, serial transport exposure is split into two user-facing
features:

-   **`serial-rtu`**: Enables serial transport for RTU-oriented builds.
-   **`serial-ascii`**: Enables serial transport for ASCII-oriented builds.

The top-level crate also exposes:

-   **`async`**: Enables the `mbus-async` facade.
-   Function-group flags (`coils`, `registers`, `discrete-inputs`, `fifo`, `file-record`, `diagnostics`) that propagate through the stack.

## Modbus TCP Client State Machine

The client activity flow for Modbus TCP is defined by a deterministic state machine, adhering to "MODBUS Messaging on TCP/IP Implementation Guide V1.0b" Figure 11: *MODBUS Client Activity Diagram*. This state machine describes the lifecycle of a single transaction in a sequential (non-concurrent) Modbus TCP client.

### Design Goals

-   **Deterministic**: Predictable behavior for reliable operation.
-   **Transport-agnostic**: Decoupled from the underlying communication medium.
-   **Bare-metal friendly**: Designed for resource-constrained environments.
-   **Suitable for `poll()`-driven execution**: Enables non-blocking operation.
-   **Easily extensible for retry logic**: Facilitates robust communication.

### Overview

The client operates in a loop, managing the following steps for each transaction:

1.  Waiting for user request.
2.  Building the MODBUS request.
3.  Sending the request to the TCP management layer.
4.  Waiting for a response (with a configurable timeout).
5.  Processing the confirmation.
6.  Returning the result to the user.

Retry logic is applied if a timeout occurs.

    Idle --> Wait

    Wait --> BuildRequest : RequestFromUser

    BuildRequest --> SendRequest

    SendRequest --> WaitingForResponse : SendOK
    SendRequest --> SendNegativeConfirmation : SendNotOK

    WaitingForResponse --> ProcessConfirmation : ResponseReceived
    WaitingForResponse --> FindPendingTransaction : WaitingResponseTimerExpired

    ProcessConfirmation --> SendPositiveConfirmation : ConfirmationOK
    ProcessConfirmation --> SendNegativeConfirmation : ConfirmationError

    FindPendingTransaction --> SendRequest : RetriesNotReached
    FindPendingTransaction --> SendNegativeConfirmation : RetriesReached

    SendPositiveConfirmation --> Wait
    SendNegativeConfirmation --> Wait
```

### State Descriptions

-   **Idle**: The initial state, indicating no active transaction.
-   **Wait**: The client is awaiting a user request, a TCP response, or a response timeout.
-   **BuildRequest**: The Modbus PDU is constructed and wrapped into an ADU.
-   **SendRequest**: The constructed request is sent to the TCP transport layer.
-   **WaitingForResponse**: A response timer is active, and the client is awaiting confirmation from the server.
-   **ProcessConfirmation**: The received response is parsed and validated.
-   **FindPendingTransaction**: Triggered by a response timeout, this state determines if a retry is allowed based on the retry logic.
-   **SendPositiveConfirmation**: A successful result is sent to the user application.
-   **SendNegativeConfirmation**: A failure result is sent to the user application.

## Transport Layer (`mbus-core/src/transport/mod.rs`)

The transport layer provides abstractions for transmitting Modbus Application Data Units (ADUs) over various physical and logical mediums.

### Core Concepts

-   **`Transport` Trait**: A unified interface that abstracts the underlying communication (TCP, Serial, or Mock) from the high-level protocol logic. Implementors are responsible for connection management, framing, sending, and receiving data.
-   **`ModbusConfig`**: A comprehensive configuration enum for setting up TCP/IP or Serial (RTU/ASCII) parameters.
-   **`UnitIdOrSlaveAddr`**: A type-safe wrapper for Modbus addresses, ensuring validity and explicitly handling broadcast addresses.

### Design Goals

-   **`no_std` Compatibility**: Utilizes `heapless` data structures and `core` traits for bare-metal embedded systems.
-   **Non-blocking I/O**: The `Transport::recv` interface is designed to be polled, allowing the client to remain responsive without requiring an OS-level thread.
-   **Extensibility**: Users can implement the `Transport` trait for custom hardware.

### Error Handling

Errors are categorized into `TransportError`, which can be seamlessly converted into the top-level `MbusError` used throughout the crate.

## Client Services (`mbus-client/src/lib.rs`)

The `mbus-client` crate provides the `ClientServices` struct, which acts as the central coordinator for Modbus transactions.

### Responsibilities

-   **Request Lifecycle Management**: Manages ADU construction, transmission, response tracking, timeouts, and retries.
-   **Pipelining**: Supports multiple concurrent outstanding requests (configurable via const generics).
-   **Reliability**: Built-in support for automatic retries and configurable response timeouts.
-   **Memory Safety**: Employs `heapless` for all internal buffering, eliminating dynamic allocation.
-   **Protocol Coverage**: Implements standard function codes for various Modbus operations.
-   **`App` Traits**: Defines traits (e.g., `CoilResponse`, `RegisterResponse`) that users implement to receive asynchronous callbacks when a response is parsed.

### Connection Lifecycle

`ClientServices` construction is intentionally side-effect-free:

- `ClientServices::new(...)` and `ClientServices::new_serial(...)` build the state machine and validate configuration.
- Applications must call `client.connect()` explicitly before sending requests.
- `client.reconnect()` remains available for recovery, and flushes pending requests with `ConnectionLost` before reconnecting.

The `ClientServices` orchestrates the interaction between the state machine, the transport layer, and the application-specific response handlers.

## Async Layer (`mbus-async`)

The `mbus-async` crate is an async facade that sits on top of `mbus-client`. It does not replace the synchronous protocol core; instead, it bridges the poll-driven state machine to Tokio's async executor via a dedicated worker thread and Tokio oneshot channels.

### Design Philosophy

- The synchronous protocol stack (`mbus-core`, `mbus-client`) is unchanged.
- A background `std::thread` owns the `ClientServices` instance and drives it by calling `poll()` in a loop.
- Async callers communicate with the worker thread through a `std::sync::mpsc` channel of `WorkerCommand` values.
- Each command carries a Tokio `oneshot::Sender`. When the response arrives, the worker resolves that sender. The caller's `.await` point wakes up.
- Requests are tracked in a shared `PendingStore` (`HashMap<u16, oneshot::Sender>`), keyed by transaction id.

Async client construction is also side-effect-free:

- `AsyncTcpClient::new(...)` and `AsyncSerialClient::new_*` constructors only prepare the worker and transport config.
- Applications must call `client.connect().await?` before issuing requests.

### Components

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| `AsyncTcpClient` | Public async API for TCP connections |
| `AsyncSerialClient` | Public async API for RTU/ASCII serial connections |
| `AsyncApp` | Internal `mbus-client` app implementation; routes responses to the correct pending sender |
| `PendingStore` | Arc-Mutex map from transaction id to oneshot sender |
| `WorkerCommand` | Enum describing each possible request to the worker |
| `WorkerResponse` | Enum of typed parsed response values |
| `run_worker` | Worker loop: receives commands, drives `poll()`, manages shutdown |
| `handle_command` | Dispatches each `WorkerCommand` to the correct `ClientServices` sub-service |

### Concurrency model

```
async caller A  ──┐
async caller B  ──┤── mpsc::Sender<WorkerCommand> ──► Worker thread
async caller C  ──┘                                        │
                                                      ClientServices
                                                      poll() loop
                                                           │
                                              AsyncApp::response_callback()
                                                           │
                                             PendingStore::complete_and_remove()
                                                           │
                       ◄── oneshot resolved ───────────────┘
```

Multiple concurrent `.await` calls each get an independent transaction id and oneshot channel. The appropriate caller is woken when the worker fires the matching oneshot.

TCP pipeline depth is compile-time configurable through `AsyncTcpClient<const N: usize = 9>`,
which forwards `N` into `ClientServices<_, _, N>`. By default (`N = 9`), up to 9 requests can
be in flight before additional requests queue up in the mpsc channel. Serial defaults to
pipeline depth `1`, reflecting the half-duplex request/reply nature of Modbus serial.

### Request lifecycle

```mermaid

    participant Caller as Async Caller
    participant Client as AsyncTcpClient
    participant Chan as mpsc Channel
    participant Worker as Worker Thread
    participant CS as ClientServices
    participant App as AsyncApp

    Caller->>Client: read_holding_registers(unit, addr, qty).await
    Client->>Client: allocate txn_id, create oneshot (tx, rx)
    Client->>Chan: send WorkerCommand::ReadHoldingRegisters { txn_id, sender: tx }
    Client->>Caller: .await on rx

    Worker->>Chan: recv WorkerCommand
    Worker->>Worker: PendingStore.insert(txn_id, tx)
    Worker->>CS: registers().read_holding_registers(txn_id, ...)
    loop poll()
        Worker->>CS: poll()
        CS-->>App: read_multiple_holding_registers_response(txn_id, &regs)
        App->>Worker: PendingStore.complete_and_remove(txn_id, WorkerResponse::Registers)
    end
    Worker->>Caller: oneshot resolved → Ok(regs)
```

### Error propagation

- If `ClientServices` rejects the request synchronously (e.g. queue full), `PendingStore::fail_and_remove` is called immediately with the error.
- If the server returns a Modbus exception, `AsyncApp::request_failed` is called and the pending sender receives `Err(MbusError::ModbusException(...))`.
- If the worker thread panics or the mpsc channel is dropped, the caller receives `AsyncError::WorkerClosed`.

### Pipeline depth and const generic `N`

`run_worker` and `handle_command` are generic over the transport type and `const N: usize`, which is the pipeline size passed to `ClientServices<_, _, N>`. This allows the TCP path to use configurable pipeline depth (`N`, default 9 via `AsyncTcpClient`) and the serial path to use depth 1 while sharing the same worker implementation.

## Bindings Layer (`mbus-ffi`)

`mbus-ffi` adds two external integration surfaces on top of the Rust core:

- **Native C API**: ID-based client pool with C ABI functions for TCP/serial lifecycle, request submission, polling, and typed callback delivery.
- **WASM/browser API**: Web-facing clients for browser transport environments.

### Native C binding architecture

- C entry points are defined in `mbus-ffi/src/c/` and exported through `mbus-ffi/include/mbus_ffi.h`.
- Native clients follow the same explicit lifecycle used by Rust clients:
    - create (`mbus_tcp_client_new` / `mbus_serial_client_new`)
    - connect (`mbus_tcp_connect` / `mbus_serial_connect`)
    - request + poll
    - disconnect/free
- A pool-based ID model isolates FFI handles from Rust object ownership while preserving deterministic resource control.

### WASM binding architecture

- WASM bindings are implemented in `mbus-ffi/src/wasm/`.
- Browser smoke validation pages live in `mbus-ffi/examples/`.
- The generated browser package is emitted under `mbus-ffi/pkg/`.

### FFI validation surfaces

- Rust-side FFI tests: `cargo test -p mbus-ffi`
- Native C binding-layer test source: `mbus-ffi/tests/c_api/test_binding_layer.c`
- Native C smoke flow via workspace automation: `cargo run -p xtask -- build-c-smoke`
